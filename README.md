## Overview and Origin

Skyline AI:

The company was fonuded in 2017 by Guy Zipori, Or Hiltch, Iri Amirav and Amir Lietersdorf.

The four founders are serial AI entrepreneurs that have worked as a team for several years and have a track recrord of building and selling companies. I.e Streamrail which was acquired by IronSource in 2016 as well Visionize acquired by AVG Technologies in 2011. 

Skyline has recently been aquired by JLL but as a start-up they were able to fund 25 million dollars through a seed round of funding in May 2018 and two subsquent Series A rounds of funding in July 2018 and again in August 2019. 

## Business Activities

Skyline has branded themselves as "Sequencing the DNA of Real Estate" by utilizing predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to offer insights into asset behavior and other hidden value generating factors for potential investors. 

Skylines' targeted customer are global real estate and investment managers. As of 2022 the global professionally-managed commercial real estate market is $13.3 trillion dollars. 

Skyline has created a unique edge over their competitors by creating a proprietary ensemble of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. The platform is utlizing the largest data pool in the industry.

Powered with natuarl language processing and high-performance data infastructure all data is pulled into what Skyline refers to as a "data-lake" and then they cross-validate to ensure they are using the data sets as accurately as possible. 

## Landscape

Skyline is centered in Commercial Real Estate Investment and Management. 

The introduction of data management and AI to allow for a more accurate and much quicker analysis of potentail property investments and provide in depth comparisons of similar real estate opportunities in a given market has been a hug innovation in the industry in recent years. 

Skyline AI's top competitors include GeoPhy, Cherre, and Oaktree Capital Management.

## Results

Skyline AI is utlizing its properitary technology to obatin high return on investment and net operating income while maintaining a sizable cash flow and targeting good loan to value ratios. 

I was not able to locate company specifics reagarding ROI, NOI or LTV. 

## Recommendations

I would recommend Skyline AI to create a neural network as part of their data processing. This would allow them to make deep learning predicitions that would more closely resemble human thought and could potentially give their investors the sense of trust and confidence the their predicitons. 

Utilizing a neural network would allow Skyline to create a deep learning model that would get better over time as the network processes more and more data.
